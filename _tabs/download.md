## Example

```python
<think>
Step 1: The issue description clearly states that when using conda version 4.3.22, the default packages specified in the .condarc file (specifically ipython) are not being installed when creating a new environment, while this functionality works correctly in version 4.2.13. This indicates a regression in the handling of default packages during environment creation between these versions.

Step 2: The .condarc configuration file contains a section called 'create_default_packages' which lists packages that should be automatically included in every new environment. The fact that this configuration is being ignored in 4.3.22 suggests the problem lies in the environment creation logic that processes these default package specifications.

Step 3: Looking at the repository structure, environment creation functionality would primarily be handled in the conda/cli/ directory, specifically in files related to the create command. The main entry point for create operations would be in conda/cli/main_create.py, but the actual installation logic would be handled by conda/cli/install.py.

Step 4: The issue involves package installation behavior during environment creation, which is fundamentally an installation operation. The conda/cli/install.py file would contain the core logic for processing package installations, including handling of default packages specified in .condarc.

Step 5: The regression between versions 4.2.13 and 4.3.22 suggests the bug was introduced in changes to the installation logic rather than in the configuration parsing, as the .condarc file is being read correctly (since it works in 4.2.13). This further points to conda/cli/install.py as the likely location of the bug.

Step 6: The conda/cli/install.py file would be responsible for processing the default packages list from the configuration and ensuring these packages are included in the installation plan. The fact that this isn't happening in 4.3.22 indicates either the default packages list isn't being properly passed to the installation logic or the installation logic isn't properly processing these default packages.

Step 7: While there are other files involved in the create operation (like main_create.py), the actual package installation behavior is controlled by install.py, making it the most likely location for the bug. The issue manifests in what gets installed rather than in the creation process itself, which is why we focus on the installation logic rather than the environment creation scaffolding.

Step 8: The repository structure shows that configuration handling is separate from installation logic (with config.py in the main conda directory), but since the configuration is being read correctly (as evidenced by it working in 4.2.13), we can rule out the configuration files as the source of the bug and focus on the installation processing files.

Step 9: The conda/cli/install.py file is the central point where package installation specifications are processed and where default packages would be merged with explicitly requested packages. This makes it the most probable location for the regression that's causing default packages to be ignored in version 4.3.22.
