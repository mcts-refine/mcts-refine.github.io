```python

Step 1: The issue describes a problem with inconsistent file permissions when uploading files in Django. Specifically, when FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS is not explicitly configured, the permissions of uploaded files can vary depending on whether a MemoryUploadedFile or TemporaryUploadedFile is used. This variation stems from the underlying tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile + os.rename operation, which on some systems (like CentOS 7.4) results in file permissions being set to 0o0600 due to security considerations. The issue suggests setting a default permission (0o644) to ensure consistency across all upload scenarios.

Step 2: The relevant code snippet is found in django/conf/global_settings.py, specifically the FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS setting. This setting controls the permissions applied to newly uploaded files. The connection between the issue and this code snippet is direct: the issue describes problems arising from unset or inconsistent file permissions during uploads, and this setting is precisely what controls that behavior. The current implementation defaults to None, which leads to the described inconsistency.

Step 3: The current implementation causes the issue because of the following line-level analysis:

FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS = None

This line means that when Django handles file uploads, if no explicit permissions are set, it relies on the underlying system behavior, which varies depending on whether the file is stored in memory or written to a temporary file. The inconsistency arises from the different handling paths (MemoryUploadedFile vs TemporaryUploadedFile) leading to different permission settings on some systems. The lack of a default permission value means security and consistency cannot be guaranteed across all deployment scenarios.

Step 4: The modification strategy is straightforward: change the FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS default value from None to 0o644. This octal value represents standard read/write permissions for owner and read-only for group/others, which is a common and secure default for uploaded files. The change ensures consistency regardless of whether the upload uses memory or temporary storage, as Django will explicitly set these permissions after the upload completes. No other changes are needed as the setting already includes proper documentation about its expected format (os.chmod parameters).

Step 5: The original code is:

FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS = None

The modified code should be:

FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS = 0o644

The change replaces None with 0o644. This modification ensures that all uploaded files will have consistent permissions (owner rw-, group r--, others r--) after being processed, regardless of the upload method or system-specific behaviors. The purpose is to provide a sensible default that balances security (via 644 permissions) with functionality (consistent behavior across all upload scenarios).</think>
